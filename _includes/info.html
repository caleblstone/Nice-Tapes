    The ‘Nice Tapes’ are the creation, and life’s work, of Ronald Eugene Drumm.
    <br><br>
    Ron Drumm was born in Bath, NY, to a family of farmers in neighboring Prattsburgh, NY which lies in a bucolic region of the state just south of the Finger Lakes. When Ron was 4 years old, his father suffered a debilitating stroke leaving him mostly confined to his bed. One day, 9-year- old Ron, his mother, and his siblings were away from the family farm when their home tragically burned to the ground with their father still inside. It is believed that Ron’s father had been smoking in bed, which he was often apt to do.
    <br><br>
    The years after Ron’s father’s death were not easy on the family, especially Ron’s mother. Ron’s older brother – only 10 years his elder – took over operations of the family farm with the help of a neighboring farmer. The family lived in trailers on the family land, and Ron’s mother found work at a local Westinghouse facility assembling televisions and radios. The apparent stress of her husband’s death, losing her home, raising young children, less than ideal living conditions, a failed romantic relationship, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy were all too much for Ron’s mother to bear. On March 18, 1964 Ron’s mother tragically took her own life. She was only 39 years old. Ron was 13.
    <br><br>
    Shortly thereafter, Ron and his sister went to live with their aunt and uncle in nearby Pulteney, NY. While living there, Ron attended Hammondsport High School and ran track, played soccer, and managed the boys’ basketball team. At the same time, Ron began to build a small record collection of about 15 albums that include artists like the Byrds, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Simon and Garfunkel.
    <br><br>
    In 1968, Ron left his aunt and uncle’s home to attend Harpur College in Binghamton, NY. Ron lived in the residential community of Hinman College in Cleveland Hall. For his four years of academics at Harpur, Ron once again found himself as the manager of the men’s varsity basketball team, and he also ran cross county track. In his spare time he would scour the dorms and borrow albums from fellow students so he could record them to cassette tape on his new ‘boom box’. That boom box, and the emerging technology of analog cassette tapes, would lead Ron in a direction he never could have imagined.
    <br><br>
    From 1969 to 1971, out of sheer convenience, Ron started to make a few mix tapes mainly to have individual songs he liked on one cassette. He would take his boom box – a novelty at the time – to various student gatherings, and play the mix tapes which were an instant hit. This was also the time of the emergence of ‘bootleg’ recordings of studio outtakes and live concerts. Ron hunted for these rare recordings, and found a great source at the student run campus radio station, the Harpur Radio Workshop (WHRW-FM). He would take his boom box into the record library, patch into their turntable, and tape as many bootlegs as he could get his hands on.
    <br><br>
    As one might imagine, all of the extra-curricular activities began to take a toll on Ron’s academics. In 1971, out of necessity, Ron attended summer school. While attending summer school, one of the DJ’s at WHRW who knew Ron from the dorms and his bootleg taping at the radio station heard one of his mixes and suggested he join the station as a DJ. That summer of 1971, Ron Drumm began an affiliation with WHRW-FM which continues to this day. From almost the beginning of his tenure, Ron took the helm as Record Librarian of WHRW to help
    build, and organize, what was to become the stations vast and eclectic music collection. After a difficult beginning to his life, Ron finally found a permanent home in Binghamton, NY, and a spiritual home at WHRW-FM.
    <br><br>
    All the while, Ron was also building an impressive personal music collection of his own. In 1980 Ron turned 30 years old. Looking for a creative outlet, Ron began to do exactly what he began to do in 1969, but this time with more intent and focus. A little older, a little wiser, and whole lot more knowledgeable about music Ron set out on a journey to document the music he loved and create a vehicle to stay in close contact with the people he loved.
    <br><br>
    Thus, in Fall of 1980, was born the Nice Tape. How did the moniker come about? In addition to being a music archivist, Ron is and always has been an avid letter writer. Since 1980, Ron has sent copies of the tapes, and a hand written letter, to friends all over the world. The response to his packages usually goes something like this...”Ron, great to hear from you. Thanks for the really nice tape.” Since 1980, it is estimated Ron has sent well over 10,000 copies of Nice Tapes and letters to friends and family both far and near.
    <br><br>
    January 1, 2013 started a new chapter in the history of the Nice Tape, in that tape number 509 became the first Nice Tape mastered and distributed on Compact Disc. The technology of consumer electronics is an integral part of the Nice Tapes story, and without inexpensive analogue cassette tapes and compact discs – as well as the tools to master and copy them – these audio documents could have never been created and shared. The next logical evolutionary step was to create a central archive of the entire collection though the World Wide Web.
    <br><br>
    From humble and often difficult beginnings, Ron Drumm has created an incredible gift that he has freely shared with so many. Ron still resides in Binghamton, NY. He is happily married to his wife Noa, and in case you were wondering, the Drumm Family Farm continues its very successful operations under the stewardship of Ron’s older brother.
    <br><br>
    As this on-line archive was being created, Ron quickly completed Nice Tape 750. As long as we keep listening, rest assured, Ron will continue to produce more Nice Tapes.
    <br><br>
    The music never stops.
